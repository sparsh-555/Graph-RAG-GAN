# GraphRAG-GAN

**Graph-Guided Retrieval-Augmented Generative Adversarial Network for Faithful, Explainable Image Generation**

---

## 🚀 Overview

GraphRAG-GAN introduces a novel architecture that combines GAN-based image generation with graph-based retrieval and reasoning mechanisms. Inspired by the success of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) in language models, this framework empowers the discriminator with a structured knowledge base (a graph) to validate generated outputs beyond simple realism—enabling **semantic consistency**, **factual grounding**, and **cross-modal explainability**.

---

## 🎯 Motivation

While traditional GANs focus on fooling a visual discriminator, they often hallucinate details or diverge from ground-truth semantics. GraphRAG-GAN proposes a shift:

> "Don’t just fool the eye. Convince the graph."

By incorporating a GraphRAG-style retriever into the discriminator loop, we validate generation against **real-world relationships, facts, and structure.** This enables a new class of **grounded and controllable generation** for high-stakes domains like medicine, education, and scientific imaging.

## 🧠 Core Architecture

- `Generator`: Autoregressively generates image patches or latent representations.
- `Graph Retriever`: Queries a structured knowledge base (graph/ontology) for relevant facts or constraints.
- `Graph-Aware Discriminator`: Validates realism *and* semantic/structural alignment against the graph.

**Key Innovations:**
- Semantic-aware retrieval from a domain graph
- Node-to-image reasoning feedback loop
- Explainable validation metrics from graph traversal

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- `PyTorch` or `JAX` for model definition
- `NetworkX` / `DGL` / `PyG` for graph operations
- `FAISS` / `ChromaDB` for hybrid vector-keyword retrieval
- Optional: `LangChain` or custom RAG pipelines for node-level expansion

## 🌍 Vision

GraphRAG-GAN isn’t just a model—it’s a **new direction for generative AI**:  
One that **thinks before it paints**, **retrieves before it imagines**, and **explains what it creates**.

> This is grounded generation.
